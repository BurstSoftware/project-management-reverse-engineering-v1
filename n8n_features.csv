Feature,Description
Visual Building,Leading visual editor for fast iteration, showing results instantly; build with native nodes or custom code, suitable for everyday automations and complex AI agent workflows.
No Boilerplate,Over 400 pre-configured integrations to eliminate repetitive code, avoiding documentation issues and CORS errors; use HTTP request node for apps without pre-built nodes, supporting existing credentials or curl commands.
Fast Iteration,Enables building piece by piece with immediate feedback, showing outputs next to settings; execute only the last step or replay data without re-triggering events or enduring slow steps.
Fall Back to Code,Use code node for custom transformations in JavaScript or Python, with npm package support on self-hosted instances; employ expressions for dynamic parameters, supporting JavaScript and Tournament templating language.
Merge, Loop, Filter,Route data with switches and if nodes, create loops, and merge data; remove duplicates, split lists, aggregate items, and shape data using code.
Diverse Triggers,Start workflows with app event triggers, cron jobs, chats, or event streams; use webhooks for services without dedicated triggers, enabling nested workflow setups.
AI Nodes,Built-in AI nodes for chatting, summarizing content, and answering document queries; fast to prototype and deploy to staging or production; use LangChain for modular apps integrating into existing workflows, with control over models and data flow.
Multi-Step Agents,Use for summarizing content or answering complex queries, enhancing workflow interactions.
Existing Scaffolding,Straightforward deployment to staging and production, with various models or local LLM runs for complete control.
Modular Apps,Build on LangChain, integrating smoothly into existing workflows and embedding AI into products.
Pre-Configured Integrations,Over 400 integrations to reduce repetitive code and simplify connectivity; use HTTP request node for apps without pre-built nodes.
Completely Custom Alerting,Send error notifications anywhere, separately or all at once; call backup workflows for immediate error handling, gain insights on workflow performance over time, and stream logs to any log aggregator.
SOC 2 Compliance,SOC 2 audited with regular external pen tests to ensure data security.
Fetch Secrets,Retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Platform, HashiCorp Vault, and Infisical without saving them in n8n.
Limit Access,Use projects and roles to give team access to collections of workflows and credentials, tightening security by limiting access to relevant teams.
