Feature,Description
Centralized Case Tracking,Tracks bugs, issues, feature requests, and tasks as unified cases in one place; each case is prioritized, assigned to a single person, and customizable with subtasks for accountability and timely closure.
Customizable Workflows,Easily tailor case flows to match team needs, supporting planning at project, sprint, epic, user story, and task levels; supports methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, or Scrumban.
Backlog Management,Maintains the entire project backlog with features, bugs, and issues for easy visibility into upcoming tasks.
Separate Tracking Categories,Distinguishes between bugs, features, inquiries, and user stories (ideal for Extreme Programming or prioritized lists).
Duplicate Case Linking,Automatically links and tracks duplicate bugs or issues.
Logging and Notifications,Log bugs/issues via web forms or email; team members receive real-time notifications as cases progress through workflows.
Inbound Email Support,Automatically creates and tracks cases from incoming emails, including software-related issues.
Guest Submission,Allows external users (e.g., customers) to submit bugs without logging in, configurable per project.
Custom Fields and Tagging,Add custom fields, tags, and priority levels to cases; filter by version or any field.
Agile-First Design,Built for agile teams with sprint planning, epic management, and user story prioritization.
Evidence-Based Scheduling (EBS),Statistical algorithm that analyzes historical timesheet data to generate accurate ship date probability distributions and delivery estimates.
Time Tracking,Built-in timesheets for logging hours on cases, feeding into EBS for better forecasting.
Task Assignment and Closure,Assign tasks/subtasks with details; track progress to ensure completion.
Unified Search,Powerful, unified search across docs, wikis, articles, code, issues, bugs, and discussions; filter cases by multiple fields.
Discussion Forums and Wikis,Integrated forums for team discussions and wikis for documentation.
Subscriptions and Alerts,Subscribe to cases for email notifications on changes.
Customer Relationship Management (CRM),Basic CRM tools for managing client interactions and inquiries.
Third-Party Integrations,Seamless connections with Slack, Twitter, GitHub, Google Drive, Trello, and Jenkins (for build status reporting and API access).
XML API Access,Full API for custom integrations, including authentication handling for tools like Jenkins.
Email and Web Integrations,Supports deep linking (e.g., instant login to specific cases) and email-based workflows.
Onboarding and Usability,No training required; intuitive interface for small to medium teams, with quick setup.
Cloud-Based Deployment,Hosted option with Dockerized environment for easy scaling.
Version Control Support,Tags bugs for specific releases; integrates with source control like GitHub.
Snippets,Write a response once and reuse it for common bug reports to speed up issue tracking.
Tagging System,Auto-suggests matching tags as you type to group items efficiently.
Estimate from Grid View,Add estimates directly from the grid view of cases for quick planning.
Detailed Time Tracking,Robust time tracking for logging hours, monitoring progress, and generating burndown charts.
